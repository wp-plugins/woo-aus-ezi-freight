Woo Aus EZi Freight is a WooCommerce extension that offers brokerage freight savings for Australian merchants.

== Description ==
With Woo Aus EZi Freight, you simply unleash the power of box packing so your clients pay less for freight even when they buy several different products.

This is how it works:
Based on the product shipping data, the extension determines the accumulative weight of all goods in the shopping cart.
It then calculated the total volume of all the goods in the cart.

From there, it picks the smallest sachet or box that is able to contain all items so your clients receive the most economical freight possible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q: What does this plugin do?

A: Yes.

Q: Will this work for carts located outside Australia?

A: No. The Woo Aus EZi Freight plugin is specifically developed for Australian based businesses. However, the freight can be send worldwide.

Q: Why is this plugin better than the Australian post plugin

This means your customers pay less for freight.

Q: Is Woo Aus EZi Freight fully customisable?

A: Yes. There are lots of variables you can customise such as unlimited types of boxes, tax rates, the \"Freight Method Title\" so you can brand your freight, additional packaging days, additional handling cost, maximum shipping services limit to display and much more...

A: Yes. To take full advantage of Woo Aus EZi Freight, you need to open an account with Australian Click and Send (FREE) and InterParcel (FREE).
